                <div class=""><p>In order to promote the health and safety of employees, the need for working excessive hours should be managed by proper planning. However, it is sometimes necessary (in order to ensure continuity of service) for people to work beyond 13 continuous hours in a 24-hour period in order to complete a task(s).</p></div>
                <div class=""><p>Before doing so it is important that the possible impact of such tasks on their health and safety (and that of others who may be affected by their activities) is properly considered.   This self-risk assessment sets out the factors that need to be considered and if stand down is a likely outcome this will be verified and recorded with the OMC.</p></div>
                <div class=""><p>Please also note that this risk assessment is relevant to all employees and can also be applied before the 13 continous hour period if individuals are feeling excessively fatigued. If this is the case please ensure you verify this with the OMC - DM (Duty Manager)</p></div>
                <div class=""><p>All employees are reminded that they are expected to take a daily rest break of 30 minutes where the worker's continuous working time is more than 6 hours. If you have been unable to take this break please arrange with the OMC DM or your line manager for this to be taken immediately, regardless of your current activity</p></div>
